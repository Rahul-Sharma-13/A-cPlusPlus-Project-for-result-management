Student Report Card Management System
This is a simple C++ console application for managing student report cards. It allows the user to create, view, modify, and delete student records. The program also calculates and displays grades and percentages based on the student's marks.

Features
Create Student Records: Enter a student's roll number, name, and marks for five subjects (Physics, Chemistry, Maths, English, Computer Science). The program calculates the percentage and assigns a grade.
View All Student Records: Displays all student records in a tabular format.
Search Student Record: Retrieve and display a student's report card by entering their roll number.
Modify Student Record: Update an existing student's record by entering their roll number.
Delete Student Record: Remove a student's record by entering their roll number.
Class Result: View the report cards for all students.
Result Menu: Display the overall results or individual report cards.
Grade Calculation
The grade is calculated based on the average percentage across all subjects:

A: 60% and above
B: 50% - 59%
C: 33% - 49%
F: Below 33%
Files
student.dat: Binary file that stores the student records.
Temp.dat: Temporary file used during the deletion of a student record.
